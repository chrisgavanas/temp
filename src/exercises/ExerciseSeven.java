            Which is the least appropriate collection to remove elements?

    /*
            Removing elements from an array, would leave gaps e.g. [1, 5, 3, _, 1 ,0]
            Removing elements from ArrayList would require shifting all the rest elements by 1 (see ExerciseFour)
            Removing elements from LinkedList would require only to set the value of 2 reference values (previous and next)


           So the least appropriate collections are arrays and ArrayList
